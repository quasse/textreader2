Sam Morgen woke up at 2:15 a.m. because he could not sleep. He had dreamt of a monster. He stayed awake for thirty minutes, trying to go to sleep but he could not.
The problem, in his mind, was in his mind. He was afraid even though there was nothing to be afraid of physically. Despite this knowledge, Sam could not go to sleep.
At 3:15 a.m., frustrated and worried he might have a bad day at work the next day, due to his lack of sleep, Sam prayed. He said, "Dear God, please let me get to sleep... now."
But Sam did not sleep at that moment.
